GWTP-Spring-Sample
==================

This is a sample GWTP Spring sample used to help identify the GWTP Spring backend issues that I have been experiencing. This is not using Maven.

**Setup**

Using Apache Ivy (Eclipse IvyDE) and ant build.xml script.

1) Install IvyDE eclipse plugin (via the market).

2) Let Ivy install the dependencies.

3) Add the following files for ANT building to compile/gwt-2.5.1: gwt-user.jar, gwt-dev.jar and gwt-servlet.jar.

4) Create an "External Tool Configuration" for the ant build.xml in the arguments add **war**
